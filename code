### Team: The Fusionists | Hackathon: Gen AI Exchange Hackathon

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

[cite_start]**Project Saathi** is an empathetic and proactive Generative AI-powered wellness companion designed to support youth mental health[cite: 11]. [cite_start]It acts as an always-available, stigma-free ally, empowering young users to navigate stress, anxiety, and emotional challenges[cite: 13].

[cite_start]Our solution distinguishes itself by being context-aware, using Humanized AI conversations, and providing fully personalized support, unlike generic "one-size-fits-all" apps[cite: 18].

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

[cite_start]Traditional therapy or existing apps are often expensive, lack personalization, or offer only scripted responses[cite: 18]. Saathi solves this by providing:
* [cite_start]**24/7, judgment-free access** to AI wellness support[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Personalized mental guidance** using Gen AI to adapt to the user's emotions and personality[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Proactive support** by predicting emotional surges before crises escalate[cite: 24, 35].

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack (Powered by Google Cloud)

Our prototype is built using a serverless architecture focused on the Vertex AI platform:

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conversational AI Core** | **Vertex AI Gemini 1.5 Pro** | [cite_start]Empathetic, multimodal LLM for safe, natural dialogue[cite: 86]. |
| **Emotional Intelligence** | **Vertex AI Text & Speech** | [cite_start]Detects emotional state from user text and voice input[cite: 86]. |
| **Backend/Functions** | **Firebase Functions (Python)** | [cite_start]Securely handles all API calls to Vertex AI and database interactions[cite: 86]. |
| **Data Storage** | **Firestore / BigQuery** | [cite_start]Secure, structured logging of interactions and mood trends[cite: 86]. |
| **Safety & Moderation** | **Perspective API + Vertex AI Safety Filters** | [cite_start]Ensures all content is moderated for safety and compliance[cite: 86]. |
